    content: ActionText::Content.new("There seems to be a happy concurrence of causes in human affairs, which
    checks the growth of trade and riches, and hinders them from being
    confined entirely to one people; as might naturally at first be dreaded from
    the advantages of an established commerce. Where one nation has gotten
    the start of another in trade, it is very difficult for the latter to regain the
    ground it has lost; because of the superior industry and skill of the former,
    and the greater stocks, of which its merchants are possessed, and which
    enable them to trade on so much smaller profits. But these advantages are
    compensated, in some measure, by the low price of labour in every nation
    which has not an extensive commerce, and does not much abound in gold
    and silver. Manufactures, therefore gradually shift their places, leaving
    those countries and provinces which they have already enriched, and
    flying to others, whither they are allured by the cheapness of provisions
    and labour; till they have enriched these also, and are again banished by
    the same causes.")
